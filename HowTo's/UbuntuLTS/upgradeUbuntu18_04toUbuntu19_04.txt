**apt-get update updates the list of available packages and their versions, but it does not install or upgrade any packages.
**apt-get upgrade actually installs newer versions of the packages you have. 
After updating the lists, the package manager knows about available updates for the software you have installed.
**apt-get upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; 
apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary.
**apt autoclean: removes all stored archives in your cache for packages that can not be downloaded anymore (thus packages that are no longer in the repo or that have a newer version in the repo).
**apt clean: removes all stored archives in your cache.
**apt autoremove: this option makes apt look for packages that are installed as dependency of an already uninstalled package and removes them. 
This is used to clean up unused dependencies that remain on your system.
**do-release-upgrade :: The recommended way to upgrade a Server Edition installation is to use the do-release-upgrade utility.

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt dist-upgrade && sudo apt autoclean

Then make sure you have update-manager-core package installed.
    sudo apt install update-manager-core

Next, edit a configuration file using nano or your preferred command line text editor.
 sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
At the bottom of this file, change the value of Prompt from lts to normal.
Prompt=normal

finally
do-release-upgrade
