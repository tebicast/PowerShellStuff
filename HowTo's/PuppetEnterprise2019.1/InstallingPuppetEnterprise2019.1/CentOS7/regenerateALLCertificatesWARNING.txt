Got below from https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2019.1/regenerate_certificates.html#regenerate-certificates


On your master logged in as root, run
puppet infrastructure run rebuild_certificate_authority caserver=localhost
***Tip: If your master operates as your CA server, specify caserver=localhost. Running the command with localhost avoids the requirement to set up SSH between your master and itself.
