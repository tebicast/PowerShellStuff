######Create the SSH node group
In the console, create a group called ssh_example to designate which nodes Puppet should manage SSH on.
This group contains all of your nodes. Depending on your needs or infrastructure, you might have a different group that you assign SSH to.
1.	In the PE console, click Classification, and click Add group. 
2.	Specify options for the new node group:
o	Parent name : select All nodes
o	Group name : enter a name that describes the role of this environment node group
o	Environment: select production
o	Environment group: don't select this option
3.	Click Add
4.	Click the ssh_example group, then select the Rules tab.
5.	In the Fact field, enter name.
6.	From the Operator drop-down list, select ~ (matches regex).
7.	In the Value field, enter .*.
8.	Click Add rule.
This rule "dynamically" pins all nodes to the ssh_example group. Note that this rule is for testing purposes, and that decisions about pinning nodes to groups in a production environment vary.

######Add classes from the ssh module
After you apply the ssh class and run Puppet, the public key for each agent node is exported and then disseminated to the known_hosts files of the other agent nodes in the group, and you are no longer asked to authenticate those nodes on future SSH attempts.
1.	In the console, click Classification, and find and select ssh_example group.
2.	On the Configuration tab, in the Class name field, select ssh.
3.	Click Add class, and commit changes.
Note: The ssh class now appears in the list of classes for the ssh_example group, but it has not yet been configured on your nodes. For that to happen, kick off a Puppet run.
4.	From the command line of your Puppet master, run puppet agent -t.
5.	From the command line of each PE-managed node, run puppet agent -t.
This configures the nodes using the newly assigned classes. Wait one or two minutes.
