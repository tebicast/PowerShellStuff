Tried the below from a MAC running Mojave to another mac running Mojave.

Make sure SSH Remoting is enabled by following these steps:
    Open System Preferences
    Click on Sharing
    Check Remote Login - Should say Remote Login: On
    Allow access to appropriate users

Edit the sshd_config file at location /private/etc/ssh/sshd_config
    sudo nano /private/etc/ssh/sshd_config

Make sure password authentication is enabled
    PasswordAuthentication yes
Add a PowerShell subsystem entry
    Subsystem powershell /usr/local/bin/pwsh -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile
Optionally enable key authentication <-- yes by default and we want this for security purposes
    PubkeyAuthentication yes

Restart the sshd service
    sudo launchctl stop com.openssh.sshd
    sudo launchctl start com.openssh.sshd

**Important**
PowerShell remoting over SSH relies on the authentication exchange between the SSH client and SSH service and does not implement any authentication schemes itself. 
This means that any configured authentication schemes including multi-factor authentication is handled by SSH and independent of PowerShell. 
For example, you can configure the SSH service to require public key authentication as well as a one-time password for added security. 

**TIP**
-SSHTransport
Indicates that the remote connection is established using Secure Shell (SSH).
By default PowerShell uses Windows WinRM to connect to a remote computer. 
This switch forces PowerShell to use the HostName parameter set for establishing an SSH based remote connection.

**EXAMPLE**
$session = New-PSSession -HostName 10.168.0.24 -UserName mojave1 -SSHTransport
Enter-PSSession -id 1

**EXAMPLE**
$session = New-PSSession -HostName 10.168.0.24 -UserName mojave1 -SSHTransport
$session
