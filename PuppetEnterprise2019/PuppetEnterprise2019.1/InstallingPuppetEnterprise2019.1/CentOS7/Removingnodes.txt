Note: Removing a node doesn't uninstall the agent from the node.

puppet node purge <CERTNAME>
The nodeâ€™s certificate is revoked, the certificate revocation list (CRL) is updated, and the node is deactivated in PuppetDB and removed from the console. 
The license is now available for another node. The node can't check in or re-register with PuppetDB on the next Puppet run.
