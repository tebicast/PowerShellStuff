Clear and regenerate certs for Puppet agents

To replace the certs on agents, you’ll need to log into each agent node and do the following steps.
1.	Stop the agent service. On *nix:
sudo puppet resource service puppet ensure=stopped
On Windows, with Administrator privileges: 
puppet resource service puppet ensure=stopped
2.	Locate Puppet’s SSL directory and delete its contents.
The SSL directory should be at /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/sslor C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc\ssl.
3.	Restart the agent service. On *nix:
sudo puppet resource service puppet ensure=running
On Windows, with Administrator privileges:
puppet resource service puppet ensure=running
When the agent starts, it generates keys and requests a new certificate from the CA master.
4.	If you are not using autosigning, log in to the CA master server and sign each agent node’s certificate request.
To view pending requests, run:
sudo puppet cert list
To sign requests, run:
sudo puppet cert sign <NAME>
Once an agent node’s new certificate is signed, it's retrieved within a few minutes and a Puppet run starts.
Once you have regenerated all agents’ certificates, everything should be fully functional under the new CA.
